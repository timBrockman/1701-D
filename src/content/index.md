### Professional Engagements

###### IT Manager
_**Republic First Management & Republic Equity** - Winter Park, FL_
  
Everyone fails from time to time.
When the status quo becomes failure; it takes perserverance to build relationships, champion positive changes, and audit the effectiveness of those changes.
The chance of stepping into faltering businesses; renovating the legacy equipment, policies, culture; and being part of a positive turnaround is part of what this role offers.

I am currently studying [FitSM](http://fitsm.itemo.org/fitsm-standard) and may write about it at some point.
