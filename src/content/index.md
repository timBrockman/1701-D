### Professional Engagements

###### Web Developer
_**For Hire** - Your Project or Organization_

> - Is your company building a disciplined team of software engineers?
> - Are you embracing a DevOps philosophy, and looking for developers with operations and support experience?
> - Do you value best practices and industry standards enough to have maintain internal style guides?
>
>Software development merges creative problem solving with discipled testing and refactoring. 
>After occupying my free time writing software and browsing GitHub projects for open issues I could resolve, it became clear I should transition to development. 
>Though I have been developing web applications and sites for a long time, I would happily accept any role to work with the right team.

_**The Open Source Community**_

>In spite of programming most of my life, contributing to [great projects along side brilliant engineers](https://github.com/PolymerElements/app-layout/graphs/contributors) has been inaccessible and intimidating. 
>In early 2016, after being prompted by a Udacity lesson, it was time to get over my trepidation and do my part to support some great projects.
>I started browsing GitHub issues on several projects, looking for concrete solvable problems.
>
>The first one I found was issue [#404 in the Kubernetes documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io/issues/404), an issue I knew how to solve.
>Shortly afterward, I found a minor issue with the demo pages of [Polymer Elements App Layout](https://github.com/PolymerElements/app-layout). 
>As simple as it was, having this pull request accepted was really exciting.
>While neither of these contributions were massive, I was proud to be a small part of two projects that are changing the web. 
>
>In addition to contributing to other projects, I release most of my work under the [MIT license](http://bro.mit-license.org) on GitHub.

###### IT Manager
_**Republic First Management & Republic Equity** - (January 2013 - Current) Winter Park, FL_
>It takes perseverance to build relationships, to champion positive changes, and to audit the effectiveness of those changes.
>My current role provides the chance to assist faltering businesses, renovate the legacy equipment, policies, and culture. 
>Being part of a positive turnaround is a rare opportunity;
>this private equity group promised an abundance of such experiences.

>Currently I am studying [FitSM](http://fitsm.itemo.org/fitsm-standard) as a lightweight path to ISO 20000-1 compliance.

_**For Hire** - Your Project or Organization_

>Even with the best solutions, service models, and frameworks; there is something new to be learned from every challenge. 
>Every day the IT playing field changes, often dramatically.
>I would love to help you navigate your business through both the orthodox and unique set of challenges you face.
