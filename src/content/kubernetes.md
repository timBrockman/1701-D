Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

In early May, I noticed an issue with the demo project documentation pertaining to the way Docker for Mac OS assigned the default localhost IP for the docker VM. When onboarding new developers with little Docker experience, this could be a big deal. This was my first attempt at a Github contribution to a major open source project. I was thrilled when, after several revisions, my branch was merged.
