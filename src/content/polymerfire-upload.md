Firebase Image Upload is a simple Polymer element using PolymerFire to upload images (or files) to Firebase Storage. This is a stripped down image uploader similar to the one in The Firecast Tutorial: Getting Started with Storage on the Web. The only major difference is it was created as a Polymer element.

Firebase Image Upload was initially created to go with a Polymer demo/lightning talk, but could easily be forked into something more useful and validatey.
