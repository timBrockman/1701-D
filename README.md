## Currently Iteration
  This personal page is designed to take as little development time as possible.
  It uses no frameworks or libraries. Just plain ol' html and css with a little optimization at build time.

## current todo:
    [ ] reconsider rem
    [ ] better on big screen (not just bigger)
    [ ] browser support audit (var, calc, clip-path, flex, shape-outside)
    [ ] @supports wrap
    [ ] ie/edge/lynx fallback/alternative
    [ ] a11y/508 audit
    [ ] a18n?
    [ ] generalize & extract css those who may want alone
    [ ] preprocessors for those who still use that stuff
    [ ] amp this (ampproject)
    [ ] templatize: mustache, jenkyll, hugo.io
